Subject: Link-me trial follow up survey reminder



<h4>Dear [% firstname -%]</h4>

<p>This is a reminder that your next Link-me survey is still available for you to complete. Link-me is testing new ways of managing mental health and well-being in Australia and we want to know what you think!</p>

<p>So don't forget to have your say; simply click here to get started. The survey takes about 10-15 minutes to do.  If you’d rather not do it online you’re welcome to complete it in person at your GP clinic or over the phone with one of our team; contact us at link-me@unimelb.edu.au to arrange a time that’s convenient for you.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>The Link-me team</p>
