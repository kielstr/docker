- term: randomised controlled trial
  definition: |
    <em><p>Randomised controlled trials are the gold standard of scientific testing. They let us compare different approaches to care and find out whether one is more effective than the other. Random allocation helps make sure that the people trying each approach to care are similar.</p>
    <p>Neither the Link-me team nor your GP have control over who will be allocated to each approach to care.</p></em>
- term: What are the benefits and risks of taking part?
  definition: |
    <em><p>Benefits: Link-me will provide you the opportunity to reflect on your mental health and wellbeing. With your help, we can find out if the Link-me approach can help people find the right support for their mental health. </p>
    <p>Risks: For some people, reflecting on mental health and wellbeing can be distressing. If you are concerned, please speak to your GP.</p></em>
