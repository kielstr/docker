Subject: Link-me trial follow up survey reminder

<h4>Dear [% firstname -%]</h4>

<p>We realise life is busy and you might not have had time to come back and complete the next Link-me survey yet. If you would be able to do this in the next couple of days weâ€™d really appreciate it.</p>

<p>The survey only takes about 10 minutes to complete and is available here.</p>

<p>If you would prefer to complete the survey in person at your GP clinic or over the phone with one of our team, please contact us at <a href="mailto:link-me@unimelb.edu.au.">link-me@unimelb.edu.au.</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>The Link-me team</p>
