Subject: Your Link-me resources

<h4>Dear [% firstname -%]</h4>

<p>Thanks for taking part in Link-me.</p>

<p>We will give you a call in the next couple of days to talk more about how the Link-me navigation program works and to schedule your first appointment.  </p>

<p>The Link-me navigator is a health professional who is specially trained to work closely with you and your GP to help you identify and access the right support to keep you well. Appointments with the Link-me navigator are completely free.</p>

<p>In the meantime if you feel like you need extra help to manage your mental health, please talk to your GP. We have also attached a list of other services you might find useful; all have excellent websites and most have helplines that are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They’re all totally confidential and are staffed by trained counsellors.</p>

<h4>A special request from us</h4>

<p>To help us understand more about how the Link-me approach works we would like to access routinely collected data about your use of health services. To do this we need you to give permission by completing this form. You can read more about this in the information sheet attached. You can still take part in Link-me even if you don’t want us to access this information.</p>


<p>Thank you</p>

<p>The Link-me team</p>
